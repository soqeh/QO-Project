> **Personal AI‑assisted exploration of a “quantitative ontology” approach to particle‑physics constants.**
> This repository is offered *as‑is* for reproducibility only; it is **read‑only** and not actively maintained.

## What This Repo *Does* Contain

* **Minimal Python scripts / notebooks** used to rerun selected AI‑driven derivations showcased in the external papers.
* **Sample data** strictly required by those scripts.

## What This Repo *Does NOT* Contain

* The full PDF set of AI dialogue exports, proofwalks, or validation logs — those are hosted separately on ResearchGate.
* A polished library, extensive documentation, or tutorial‑style notebooks.
* An active issue tracker, discussion forum, or guaranteed technical support.

## Disclaimer

These scripts are **experimental demonstrations** provided on a *best‑effort* basis. I pursue this work in spare moments outside an unrelated full‑time job, so my availability is limited. Contributions are welcome, but please understand that **responses to issues or pull requests may be delayed or, at times, not feasible.** Use at your own risk.
